# RPGsite
A small project to practice some basics and try some new things on the Front End and Back End. 

# Documentation
So far big changes to my normal formula have been creating a Routes.js file, using Switch for routing, downgrading react-router-dom to version 5.3.0, and lastly turning the site into an SPA by using the Lazy and Suspense components. 

# Current Progress - 8/28/2023
I have a complete signup and login page with a build in navbar, token create and secret key creation in the back end to be as secure as possible. It also loads into the dashboard after you login, but nothing displays, which needs to be fixed. Overall this has taught me a lot about web security on the front end and back end which is crucial for me to know.
